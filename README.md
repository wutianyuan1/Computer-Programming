# CS100 - Computer Programming - Shanghaitech

This is a collection of CS100 course projects in 2019 fall.
It contains 8 individual projects, you need to write all of them in **C or C++**.


## What can I learn from these projects?
- Syntax of C and C++ programming language
    - Concepts of compiling, assembling, linking, loading
    - Variables & functions
    - Operations
    - Structures
    - Control flow
- Recursion
- Object oriented programming (Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism)
- Templates
- CMake
- Basic multi-thread programming
- Part of new features of C++11/14/17
- Basic functional programming



- Dependencies management (Eigen, OpenCV...)

## Contents of each project/homework
- HW1 (Simple problems)
    - Basic syntax of C
- HW2 (Simple problems)
    - Basic syntax of C
- HW3 (Linked List & Sorting)
    - Structures
    - Pointers
- HW4 (C++ DynamicArray & Simple Game)
    - OOP Part I (Encapsulation)
- HW5 (C++ calculater, Structured Output, LookupTable)
    - OOP Part II (Inheritance & Polymorphism)
- HW6 (More complex C++ programming)
    - More Complex OOP
    - Templates
    - Operator overloading
- HW7 (Image filtering)
    - CMake
    - Multi-threading
    - Concepts of convolution
    - Eigen
- HW8 (Polynomials, derivatives, Newton's Method)
    - Templates
    - Iterators
    - Operator overloading
    - Functional programming (lambdas)

## How long will I spend on these problems?
- For me (one of head TAs of this course, and the author of part of this projects), about 15 hours in total
- If you have never learned programming before, maybe 2 weeks or much longer
